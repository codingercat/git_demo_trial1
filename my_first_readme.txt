Track => Git start keeping record of any changes that appear in tracked file
    - Working tree (on your local system)
        - Everything you are editing and saving on your local system- keeping track of this
    - Local Commits (git keeps record of changes in a sanctified records on your local system, looks like- hashValue: customCommitMessage: <changes>)
    - Pushed commits (syncronization of local commits with online records)
